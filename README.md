# Linear Transformation Program Readme

This repository contains a Python program for performing linear transformations on objects in two-dimensional and three-dimensional spaces.

## Part One

### Features
- **Object Creation and Visualization**
  - Create and visualize two different objects using NumPy and Matplotlib.
  - Objects should be distinct for clear observation of transformation effects.

- **Implementation of Linear Transformations**
  - Rotation of objects by a specified angle.
  - Scaling of objects by a specified factor.
  - Reflection of objects about a specified axis.
  - Shearing of objects along a specified axis.
  - Implementation of custom transformations using custom transformation matrices.

- **Experimentation and Conclusion**
  - Experiment with different transformation matrices.
  - Document observations and conclusions regarding the impact of matrix elements on transformations.

- **Extension to Three-Dimensional Space**
  - Experiment with linear transformations in three-dimensional space.
  - Apply at least two different transformations to a three-dimensional object.

## Part Two

### Features
- **Selection of Library**
  - Choose OpenCV for its comprehensive toolkit for linear transformations.

- **Implementation of Linear Transformations**
  - Implement all linear transformations using OpenCV.
  - Compare results obtained using predefined functions with those from custom functions.

- **Application on Images**
  - Read a sample image using OpenCV.
  - Apply two to three linear transformations to the image.
  - Display the resulting images.
